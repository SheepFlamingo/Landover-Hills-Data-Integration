# Landover-Hills-Data-Integration
Partnering with the Town of Landover Hills, our team is developing a sustainable, automated system to publish municipal data on the Maryland Open Data Portal. This **iConsultancy** pilot project will create a replicable "starter kit" for other small towns, transforming local government transparency and efficiency across the state.
